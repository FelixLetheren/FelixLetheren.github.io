            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a full stack developer based in Bath. I am learning with
                Mayden Academyâ€™s full stack track course to gain a broad
                understanding of web development. I am a highly driven individual
                with experience working in a team environment. Throughout my career
                in hospitality I have learnt effective team and time management
                and have built upon these skills working as a development team
                with Mayden Academy.
